# Music Store Data Analysis using SQL

This repository contains SQL solutions for analyzing a music store database. The analysis addresses key business questions using SQL queries, providing insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and operational metrics.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to utilize SQL queries to answer business-related questions, such as identifying top customers, high-revenue cities, and popular music genres. The project is divided into two sets of questions: Easy and Moderate, each with specific queries designed to extract meaningful insights.

### Question Set 1 - Easy

1. **Senior Most Employee**  
   Query to identify the senior-most employee based on job role.

2. **Countries with Most Invoices**  
   Identifies countries with the highest number of invoices, giving insights into international sales distribution.

3. **Top 3 Invoice Totals**  
   Retrieves the highest total invoice values to assess top purchases.

4. **City with Best Customers**  
   Finds the city generating the most revenue, helping with targeted promotional events.

5. **Best Customer**  
   Determines the customer who has spent the most money, recognizing high-value clients.

### Question Set 2 - Moderate

1. **Rock Music Listeners**  
   Returns the email, first name, last name, and genre of all rock music listeners, ordered alphabetically.

2. **Top Rock Artists**  
   Identifies the top 10 rock artists based on track count, aiding in artist-specific promotions.

3. **Longer-than-Average Songs**  
   Lists all track names and lengths that exceed the average song length, ordered by duration.

## Getting Started

To run these queries:

1. Import the provided music store database into your SQL environment.
2. Use the queries included in the `queries.sql` file or write your own based on the questions above.
3. Execute each query to retrieve insights.

### Prerequisites

- SQL-compatible environment (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)
- Access to the music store database schema

## File Structure

- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions.
- `queries.sql`: SQL queries for each question in the analysis.
- `database_schema.png`: Visual representation of the music store database schema.
